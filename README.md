I want to create a login page that will say login with Microsoft and take us to the working login with azure. 

I also want a username and password box where we can login using a username and password

We will need to create a database to store the credentials. I also know we'll create a model for it. I'll want to make sure it's using sqlachemy 2.

I want to install cloud flare so I can control dns access

I want to setup a way to manage access from routes

We will need to start breaking the code into seperate files.
